Visualisation tool to help dealing with the logistics of multiple timezones. 

See demo here: https://offset.surge.sh/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Todo

Soon:
- [ ] Publish to Github repo
- [ ] Make work with fractions of hours as offsets
- [ ] Add button to flip me/them
- [ ] Add interval to keep time updated
- [ ] Make tooltips/modals look nicer
- [ ] Allow editing of office hours

Later:
- [ ] Use code splitting to import moment (or moment-timezones) to set/display offset by name
- [ ] Allow choosing a different time of year with locations
- [ ] Use local storage to remember recent states (maybe only on exit, or on timer, ...)
- [ ] Allow comparing more than two different timezones/locations at once
